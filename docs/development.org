* Essential Files

- _i18n.csv_: internationalization configuration.
  
- _sync-versions.bash_: synchronize versions embedded in source files,
  versions are:
  - pick-src-tdlib: the linkage of TDLib targeted by tg-focus.
  - pick-ver-tdlib: the version of TDLib targeted by tg-focus.
  - pick-ver-tgfocus: the current release version of tg-focus.
  Note: running the script should result in no effect most of the
  time, because picking versions should be an infrequent operation.
  
- /deb10-gcc12.bash/: a script that prepares the dedicated
  toolchain(GCC) on the dedicated platform(Debian). Note: the
  corresponding preparation script must sync with this file.
